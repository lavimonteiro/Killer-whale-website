    <h2>Famous Orcas</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Luna the whale</strong></li>
      <p>
        Luna also known as L98 or Tsux'iit, was a killer whale born in Puget
        Sound. After being separated from his mother while still young, Luna
        spent five years in Nootka Sound, an ocean inlet of western Vancouver
        Island, where he had extensive human contact and became recognized
        internationally.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Springer</strong></li>
      <p>
        Springer, officially named A73, is a wild orca from the Northern
        Resident Community of orcas which every summer frequent the waters off
        the northern part of Vancouver Island, British Columbia.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Tilikum</strong></li>
      <p>
        Tilikum, nicknamed Tilly, was a captive killer whale who spent most of
        his life performing at SeaWorld Orlando. He was captured in Iceland in
        1983 at Hafnarfjörður, near Reykjavík. About a year later, he was
        transferred to Sealand of the Pacific in Victoria, British Columbia.

    <h2>Media</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Luna: Spirit of the Whale (TV Movie 2005)</li>
      <p>
        When a government representative announces that he intends to reunite an
        orphaned orca with his pod by transporting him hundreds of miles over
        dry land, the Mowachaht-Muchalaht First Nations Band, which believes
        that the spirit of their late chief resides in the majestic ocean
        mammal, does everything within their power to thwart the controversial
        plan. As the community grows increasingly divided over how to handle the
        situation, a young aboriginal boy wrestles with his own identity and new
        chief Mike Maquinna prepares for the trial by fire that could shape his
        entire future.

        Tilikum, a captive killer whale, has taken the lives of three people.
        This impassioned documentary tells his story to unravel the consequences
        of keeping orcas in captivity and reveal how little is known about these
        highly intelligent mammals.
